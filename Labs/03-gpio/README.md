## Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home)

1. Draw two basic ways to connect a LED to the output pin of the microcontroller: LED active-low, LED active-high.

| **LED color** | **Supply voltage** | **LED current** | **LED voltage** | **Resistor value** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| red | 5&nbsp;V | 20&nbsp;mA | 2V | 150 ohm |
| blue | 5&nbsp;V | 20&nbsp;mA | 3V | 100 ohm|

See [schematic of Arduino Uno board](../../Docs/arduino_shield.pdf) in docs folder of Digital-electronics-2 repository and find out which pins of ATmega328P can be used as input/output pins. To which pin is the LED L connected? Is it connected as active-low or active-high? Note that labels on Arduino `~3`, `~5`, etc. do not mean that the signals are inverted; the `~` symbol indicates that a PWM (Pulse-width modulation) signal can be generated on these pins.
